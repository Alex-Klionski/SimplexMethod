# SimplexMethod
Linear Programming using 
Method using python, jupyter notebook, numpy 
Initialize your jupyter Notebook from terminal
Then Run the simplex_method.ipynb
Note: run all the cells so as to activate the libraries
Run the last cell and inout thr correct details there: 
Enter no. of coeff (n): Count number of Cost Coefficient
Enter no. of constraints (m): 
"Enter A:  A = | 0.25  0.6  1.03   2 |
               | 5      8    8    10 |
 Enter A:
 Enter b:
 Enter c:
 
 
#min c`x
# Ax=b
# x>=0

# A: The constraint matrix 
# b: The rhs vector 
# c: The vector of cost coefficients 
# C: The indices of the basic variables corresponding to an initial basic feasible solution
